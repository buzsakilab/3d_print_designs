# Metal microdrive
Metal microdrive designs for silicon probes.

## Ordering and Purchasing instructions
We provide all necessary stl files and instructions for assembling the microdrives yourself. You may also order them from our production partner 3Dneuro. 

### Ordering and assemble the drive yourself
The .step files are optimized for stainless steel 316L, 20 micrometer resolution and aluminum AlSi10Mg, high resolution using Proto Labs (https://www.protolabs.com/).

In order to receive high quality prints from ProtoLabs, please follow these instructions.

1. Add the following note to _drive_v09_: "Use orientation as in quote 9301-742"
2. Add the following note to _arm_v09_aluminum_: "Use orientation as in quote 2379-080"

For other printers, materials or company, some modifications may be necessary.

### Purchasing fully assembled microdrives
To purchase fully assembled drives, please contact [3Dneuro](https://www.3dneuro.com/2021/04/23/new-metal-microdrive-in-collaboration-with-the-buzsaki-lab/) (our partner in production).
