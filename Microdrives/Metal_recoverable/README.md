Metal microdrive designs for silicon probes.

**Assembly instructions**

Assembly instructions can be found in the **assembly_instructions_metal_microdrive_v9.pdf** file.

**Ordering instructions**

The .step files are optimized for stainless steel 316L, 20 micrometer resolution and aluminum AlSi10Mg, high resolution using Proto Labs (https://www.protolabs.com/). Please see *ordering_instructions.txt* for more information. 
For other printers, materials or company, some modifications may be necessary.
