Metal microdrive designs for silicon probes (**v10 is not back compatible with previous versions**).

**ASSEMBLY**

Assembly instructions can be found in the **assembly_instructions_metal_microdrive_v10.pdf** file. Assembly video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poEjWvFrr5g. 
Attaching Neuropixels probe (or any other silicon probe) video can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpPdWJEo7Fo

**ORDERING**

The .step files are optimized for stainless steel 316L, 20 micrometer resolution (drive_v10) and aluminum AlSi10Mg, high resolution (arm_v10 and base_v10) using Proto Labs (https://www.protolabs.com/). Please see *ordering_instructions.txt* for more information. 
For other printers, materials or company, some modifications may be necessary.


**PURCHASING fully assembled microdrives**
