Microdrive designs for silicon probes.

Assembly instructions can be found in the assembly_instructions_metal_microdrive_v7.pdf file.

The .step files are optimized for stainless steel 316L, 20 micrometer resolution using Proto Labs (https://www.protolabs.com/). For other printers, materials or company, some modifications may be necessary.

1 version is made available here:
v7: shell base 3.1 x 5 mm (WxL); height: 15 mm; travel distance 7 mm


The .stl files are optimized for Formlabs Form2 printer and Grey-v4/Clear-v4 Resin. For other printers and/or resins, some modifications may be necessary.

1 version is made available here:
v7: stereotax attachment and drive holder.
