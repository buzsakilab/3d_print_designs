Microdrive designs for silicon probes.

The .stl files are optimized for Formlabs Form2 printer and Grey-v4/Clear-v4 Resin. For other printers and/or resins, some modifications may be necessary.

1 version is made available here:

This microdrive was modified based on Mihaly Voroslakos' design. Other version of this microdrive is available at https://github.com/buzsakilab/3d_print_designs/tree/master/Microdrives/Plastic_recoverable.

The original idea of the drive is described in the following paper.
